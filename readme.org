#+TITLE: Nix Configuration

* Overview
This is my NixOS + MacOS Nix shared configuration. It is based on merging two configurations:

- [[https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config][nixos-config]]: This facilitates sharing packages between computers, I strongly recommend it as a base configuration to use as a base.
- [[https://github.com/leoank/neusis][neusis]]: This is the config used for multiple servers in at the Broad Institute's Imaging Platform. I use it to support multiple users on NixOS alongside Darwin.
* Set up
I haven't set it up from scratch in a new set of computers, but I will update it once I do.
  
* Usage
Both require superuser permissions, but in Darwin will be asked for when installing brew-based packages.

Replace =moby= or =darwin001= with the file you want to use on =machines/=

** NixOS
#+begin_src bash
nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#moby
#+end_src

*** Update home only
If you just want to update your home configuration and packages use this command.
#+begin_src bash
home-manager --flake .#your-username@your-hostname
#+end_src
** Darwin
#+begin_src bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#darwin001
#+end_src


* Where should I add packages?
Relative to the root folder of the repo.

|        | System-wide                 | home                                  |
|--------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------|
| NixOS  | modules/nixos/packages.nix  | homes/$USER/packages.nix              |
| Darwin |                             | modules/darwin/packages.nix           |
| Both   | modules/shared/packages.nix | [WIP] modules/shared/home-manager.nix |

System-wide Darwin packages is not supported yet.
* Current work
- Trimming the fat
- Adding multiple configs for multiple Darwin computers
- Modify things so they are closer to [[https://github.com/dustinlyons/nixos-config][nixos-config]] than neusis.
- Add support to user-based config update
- Isolate GPU packages and services
